# The_Sparks_Foundation_Internship
Data Science and Business Analytics tasks implemented during the duration of The Sparks Foundation Internship (i.e.) GRIP (Graduate Rotational Internship Program):
# Task 1: 
## Prediction of scores obtained by students using Supervised Machine Learning:
This task is implemented using a simple Linear Regression model as it involves only two variables (i.e.) No. of hours studied and Scores obtained by the students. The model predicts the score obtained based on the number of hours a student devotes in studies. Higher the study hours, higher the score obtained. Here, no. of hours is independent variable and score obtained is a dependent variable.

# Task 2:
## From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually by using Unsupervised Machine Learning
This task is implemented using k-means clustering model, where 'k' represents number of clusters. The optimum value of k can be obtained from the elbow graph. It is classified as Unsupervised ML because there are no labels involved (i.e.) there are no dependent and independent variables. This model segregates different types of Iris into different clusters based on their given features (i.e.) Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length and Petal Width.
