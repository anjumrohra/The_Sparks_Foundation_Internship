# The_Sparks_Foundation_Internship
Data Science and Business Analytics tasks implemented during the duration of The Sparks Foundation Internship (i.e.) GRIP (Graduate Rotational Internship Program):
# Task 1: 
## Prediction of scores obtained by students using Supervised Machine Learning:
This task is implemented using a simple Linear Regression model as it involves only two variables (i.e.) No. of hours studied and Scores obtained by the students. The model predicts the score obtained based on the number of hours a student devotes in studies. Higher the study hours, higher the score obtained. Here, no. of hours is independent variable and score obtained is a dependent variable.
